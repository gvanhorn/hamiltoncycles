    <h1>Complexity of the Hamilton Cycle Problem</h1>
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The figure on this page illustrates the complexity of the hamilton cycle problem,
            the problem of determining whether a path exists that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once and ends at the starting vertex.
            The inspiration for this page came from a paper by Cheeseman, Kanefsky and Taylor "Where the <em>Really</em> hard problems are" (1991), and a desire
            to enlarge and clarify their figures on this topic.

        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Depth-First</h3>
        <p>A simple depth-first search, with a random start and random ordering of neighbours</p>
        <h3>Cheeseman et al.'s backtracking algorithm</h3>
        <p>The two heuristics employed by the Cetal algorithm are:
        <ol>
            <li>Start at the node with the highest connectivity</li>
            <li>Order the neighbouring nodes of the last visited node by their connections to unvisited nodes (more is better)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Horn's backtracking algorithm</h3>
        <p>The two heuristics employed by this backtrack algorithm are:
        <ol>
            <li>Start at the node with the lowest connectivity</li>
            <li>Order the neighbouring nodes of the last visited node by their connections to unvisited nodes (less is better)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Vandergriend & Culberson's pruning algorithm</h3>
        <p>Vacul precedes search with a check for connectedness and cut-vertices (vertices that when removed cause the graph to be disconnected) to determine
            quickly if it is possible for the graph to be hamiltonian.
        </p>
        <p>During search it removes edges in the graph that cannot possibly be in the hamilton cycle, reducing the search space and iterations needed to reach a
            conclusion.

        <p>
            Hovering over a data point shows a histogram of the connectivity in that graph, with the connectivity on the x-axis and the amount of vertices that
            have that connectivity on the y-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on a data point highlights all data points with the same graph, allowing performance comparison between algorithms.
